# Protector

This project uses Javascript and the Phaser Game Engine. 

Back Story: 	In an apocalyptic world, our main character, Zaun, falls victim to a 			zombie attack, dies, and comes back as a zombie. Since Zaun is dead, he 		has a ghost. The role of the ghost is to watch over and protect his zombie 		body.

Objective: 	The aim is to stop the mindless Zaun zombie from getting hurt, harming 			others, and obtain the antidote.

Gameplay: 	Guide your zombie body using your ghost abilities that construct roads, 		walls, and beacons. Build them on any tiles on the map while keeping track 		of your energy. Collect components of the antidote while avoiding threats 		and chaos.
